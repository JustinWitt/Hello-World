# Hello-World
First things first... 
I am the sort of person who makes bad jokes in naming variables because it is amusing to me later on.
My main purpose in using Github is to have a place that I can put my code for others to see when I'm trying to get hired.
I used to be a lawyer.
I have a cat that I sometimes think of as a fuzzy terrorist.
That's enough for now.
    Btw, I like spaces for my indents but I use the tab keep set to four spaces because it makes typing faster.
